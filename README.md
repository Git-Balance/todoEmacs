# todoEmacs

This automatically adds dates to a .org file so that you can use an Emacs document as a todo list. It is written in python. You put the script in a place where it will automatically be loaded when you turn on your coputer and it will add a line to the chosen document for the current day. If you want to generate dates for the future, you can use the -d argument.
